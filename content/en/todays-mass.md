## THE LITURGY OF THE WORD

### **[SIT]** First Reading
**Reader:** A reading from the Second Book of Kings. *(2 Kings 5:14-17)*

> Naaman went down and plunged into the Jordan seven times at the word of Elisha, the man of God. His flesh became again like the flesh of a little child, and he was clean of his leprosy.
> 
> Naaman returned with his whole retinue to the man of God. On his arrival he stood before Elisha and said, "Now I know that there is no God in all the earth, except in Israel. Please accept a gift from your servant."
> 
> Elisha replied, "As the LORD lives whom I serve, I will not take it;" and despite Naaman's urging, he still refused.
> 
> Naaman said: "If you will not accept, please let me, your servant, have two mule-loads of earth, for I will no longer offer holocaust or sacrifice to any other god except to the LORD."

**Reader:** The word of the Lord.  
**All:** Thanks be to God.

### **[SIT]** Responsorial Psalm (Psalm 98)
**Cantor:** The Lord has revealed to the nations his saving power.  
**All:** The Lord has revealed to the nations his saving power.

**Cantor:** Sing to the LORD a new song, for he has done wondrous deeds; his right hand has won victory for him, his holy arm.  
**All:** The Lord has revealed to the nations his saving power.

**Cantor:** The LORD has made his salvation known: in the sight of the nations he has revealed his justice. He has remembered his kindness and his faithfulness toward the house of Israel.  
**All:** The Lord has revealed to the nations his saving power.

**Cantor:** All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation by our God. Sing joyfully to the LORD, all you lands; break into song; sing praise.  
**All:** The Lord has revealed to the nations his saving power.

### **[SIT]** Second Reading
**Reader:** A reading from the Second Letter of Paul to Timothy. *(2 Timothy 2:8-13)*

> Beloved: Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, a descendant of David: such is my gospel, for which I am suffering, even to the point of chains, like a criminal. But the word of God is not chained. Therefore, I bear with everything for the sake of those who are chosen, so that they too may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus, together with eternal glory. This saying is trustworthy:
> 
> If we have died with him we shall also live with him; if we persevere we shall also reign with him. But if we deny him he will deny us. If we are unfaithful he remains faithful, for he cannot deny himself.

**Reader:** The word of the Lord.  
**All:** Thanks be to God.

### **[STAND]** Gospel Acclamation
**All:** Alleluia, alleluia. In all circumstances, give thanks, for this is the will of God for you in Christ Jesus. Alleluia.

### **[STAND]** Gospel
**Priest/Deacon:** The Lord be with you.  
**All:** And with your spirit.  
**Priest/Deacon:** A reading from the holy Gospel according to Luke.  
**All:** Glory to you, O Lord.

**Gospel Reading (Luke 17:11-19):**
> As Jesus continued his journey to Jerusalem, he traveled through Samaria and Galilee. As he was entering a village, ten lepers met him. They stood at a distance from him and raised their voices, saying, "Jesus, Master! Have pity on us!" And when he saw them, he said, "Go show yourselves to the priests." As they were going they were cleansed. And one of them, realizing he had been healed, returned, glorifying God in a loud voice; and he fell at the feet of Jesus and thanked him. He was a Samaritan. Jesus said in reply, "Ten were cleansed, were they not? Where are the other nine? Has none but this foreigner returned to give thanks to God?" Then he said to him, "Stand up and go; your faith has saved you."

**Priest/Deacon:** The Gospel of the Lord.  
**All:** Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ.

### **[SIT]** Homily
*(The priest gives his sermon)*

### **[STAND]** Profession of Faith (Creed)
**All:** I believe in one God, the Father almighty, maker of heaven and earth, of all things visible and invisible. I believe in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Only Begotten Son of God, born of the Father before all ages. God from God, Light from Light, true God from true God, begotten, not made, consubstantial with the Father; through him all things were made. For us men and for our salvation he came down from heaven, *(all bow)* and by the Holy Spirit was incarnate of the Virgin Mary, and became man. For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate, he suffered death and was buried, and rose again on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures. He ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father. He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead and his kingdom will have no end. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life, who proceeds from the Father and the Son, who with the Father and the Son is adored and glorified, who has spoken through the prophets. I believe in one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church. I confess one Baptism for the forgiveness of sins and I look forward to the resurrection of the dead and the life of the world to come. Amen.

### **[STAND]** Prayer of the Faithful
**Priest:** *(Introduces the prayers)*  
**Reader:** *(States intentions)*  
**All:** Lord, hear our prayer. *(or similar response)*  
**Priest:** *(Concluding prayer)*  
**All:** Amen.

## **[KNEEL]** EUCHARISTIC PRAYER

### Eucharistic Prayer II (Common Choice)
**Priest:** You are indeed Holy, O Lord, the fount of all holiness.

Make holy, therefore, these gifts, we pray, by sending down your Spirit upon them like the dewfall, so that they may become for us the Body and Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ.

At the time he was betrayed and entered willingly into his Passion, he took bread and, giving thanks, broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying:

**TAKE THIS, ALL OF YOU, AND EAT OF IT, FOR THIS IS MY BODY, WHICH WILL BE GIVEN UP FOR YOU.**

In a similar way, when supper was ended, he took the chalice and, once more giving thanks, he gave it to his disciples, saying:

**TAKE THIS, ALL OF YOU, AND DRINK FROM IT, FOR THIS IS THE CHALICE OF MY BLOOD, THE BLOOD OF THE NEW AND ETERNAL COVENANT, WHICH WILL BE POURED OUT FOR YOU AND FOR MANY FOR THE FORGIVENESS OF SINS. DO THIS IN MEMORY OF ME.**

**Priest:** The mystery of faith.  
**All:** We proclaim your Death, O Lord, and profess your Resurrection until you come again.  
*Or:* When we eat this Bread and drink this Cup, we proclaim your Death, O Lord, until you come again.  
*Or:* Save us, Saviour of the world, for by your Cross and Resurrection you have set us free.

**Priest:** Therefore, as we celebrate the memorial of his Death and Resurrection, we offer you, Lord, the Bread of life and the Chalice of salvation, giving thanks that you have held us worthy to be in your presence and minister to you.

Humbly we pray that, partaking of the Body and Blood of Christ, we may be gathered into one by the Holy Spirit.

Remember, Lord, your Church, spread throughout the world, and bring her to the fullness of charity, together with N. our Pope and N. our Bishop and all the clergy.

Remember also our brothers and sisters who have fallen asleep in the hope of the resurrection, and all who have died in your mercy: welcome them into the light of your face.

Have mercy on us all, we pray, that with the Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God, with blessed Joseph, her Spouse, with the blessed Apostles, and all the Saints who have pleased you throughout the ages, we may merit to be coheirs to eternal life, and may praise and glorify you through your Son, Jesus Christ.

### **[KNEEL]** Doxology
**Priest:** Through him, and with him, and in him, O God, almighty Father, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, all glory and honor is yours, for ever and ever.  
**All:** Amen.
