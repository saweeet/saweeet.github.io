For me, this has to be one of, if not **the most important question** someone can ever ask. We're talking not just about how we came to be, but also why we were made and whether there's life after death. For many, this will never be a priority to ponder—not unless death comes knocking on their door.

My personal reasoning for why I believe has changed progressively over the years and has evolved in many ways. I started as a cradle Catholic and was taught to believe at a very young age. However, like a majority of cradle Catholics, my faith was very watered down. I remember going to a YFC (Youth for Christ) camp and on Day 1, telling everyone that I was just there for the girls. What an embarrassment! However, from that camp I saw that being Christian could be 'cool'. I saw Christians break dancing, rapping, hip-hopping, and singing praise and worship songs. Sure, it may have been a bit superficial, but it was a good start in realizing that being Christian didn't have to mean being boring.

As life progressed, I exposed myself to more Catholic circles. Slowly my faith grew through friendships, music, testimonials, keynote speakers, Catholic radio, and podcasts. I started to **connect the dots** in my faith and find satisfying reasoning to the many objections outsiders would often challenge the church with. I began to understand truths about my faith and how it would influence my everyday life. My life started to feel so free and is constantly filled with joy. My faith has taught me how to love my friends, family, and spouse in ways I would never have discovered otherwise.

So **why should you believe in the Christian God?**

## Initial Thoughts

- **Why is God even important to us?** Perhaps some of us don't want Him to be real since we may think all the 'fun' will be out of reach.
- It's unlikely that there will be a single convincing answer to prove God's existence. Rather, it's likely a combination of reasons.
- God is immaterial, so we cannot use standard material science. This doesn't mean science and faith contradict; in fact, they should complement each other if both are pointing to truth.
- Acknowledge and be aware that we're all emotionally persuaded in one way or another. This includes examining our own biases and those of the people around us. Discern whether everyone is in a healthy mindset to critically think about the reasoning put forward from both parties.
- All other major religions have messengers *from* God; however, none claim to be God themselves. **Jesus Christ is the only religious figure who claimed to be divine.**
- Convincing evidence comes from people we trust—whether scholars, friends, or loved ones.
- The Bible is a reliable source of truth. The majority of reputable historians and archaeologists use the Bible as a trustworthy source.
- To be convinced is an individual journey. One must look for answers rather than expect to be forced to believe.
- As a Catholic, I believe the Devil is real, intelligent, and very much active. The Devil is doing everything possible to stop you, to make you believe that you're okay just by being a good person and that you'll get to go to a magical place after death.
- When discussing theology and God's existence, there will always be a "what if" question—a gap of the unknown that no amount of science would ever be able to prove. However, this doesn't mean we cannot be 100% convinced. We look to probability or the likelihood that something is real or going to happen.

## Do I Think Religion Is Healthy?

I believe many of my friends would be open to the likelihood of God and even be convinced by many arguments. After all, the idea of a loving God who wants to grant you an abundance of gifts, virtues, love, and then eternity in paradise together with loved ones sounds very attractive.

As a Catholic, I believe that God created us **to build a relationship with Him**. At the root of all our desires, God alone can satisfy our hearts. Sadly, many will not pursue this idea due to social constructs—for example, the fear that Christian rules will limit their ability to have *fun* to the fullest, not wanting to be locked in, or even being outcasted from society. Consequently, these people will choose to turn a blind eye, hoping for an ignorant-is-bliss way of life. Whereas in reality, I found this to be the complete reverse: **the truth made me feel more free** and just so thankful for everything in life.

## Am I in the Correct State of Mind?

There are many who are angry with religious factions, especially the Catholic Church—and rightfully so. Though if I learned about a corrupt doctor who doesn't live up to their status, this doesn't mean I should never go to the hospital or to doctors to seek help. I would say the same for the Church with regards to those who have let the Catholic Church down. I shouldn't turn a blind eye to the Church because of people who failed to uphold our teachings. It's a reminder that no matter what our position in life, we are all going to make big and small mistakes. We should always advocate for justice to be served, with hope that all parties will heal and be better for it.

Angry people will shout the loudest, so yes, I see why we would question why we'd want to be on any harsh receiving end. Often the more passionate and angry someone is, it correlates to the degree of how much they are hurting. I'd need to rethink whether I can build a healthy bridge with these angry people—a bridge where all parties can think logically about the claims and reasoning being put forward. This includes myself. I should be aware of any emotional or biased thoughts that may be persuading one belief over another.

It's important to question oneself: **why is it important to believe in God?** After all, if we don't want to be convinced or if our minds and hearts are not prepared to receive Him, then it's most likely that all the reasoning this world could possibly ever offer will not be sufficient.

## Am I Using the Right Method?

Many are looking for a single proof—one answer that explains it all. I've listened to many debates and Catholic apologetics, and it's often said that God's existence cannot be determined by *traditional* scientific methods. Traditional, meaning where we analyze and observe material things under a microscope. This is because **God is immaterial**. Thus, we must use other methods to determine His existence. For example, I look at the truths of what I already know and use them as evidence to support our claims.

## Arguments for the Existence of God

There are many reasons and arguments for God's existence. Some can be deep and philosophical, such as Thomas Aquinas' five ways [1]. Others might be that the teachings and fruits produced by Catholicism are all aligned to something greater than ourselves [2]. I'm no theologian, so I can only share my own simple reasoning for God's existence that resonated with me. Here are **5 reasons for the existence of God:**

### 1. Jesus Christ Was a Real Person Who Walked This Earth and Claimed to Be God

No other major religious figure has claimed to do so. Many other religious figures say they're messengers or similar; none other than Jesus Christ says that He is divine Himself. Any reputable historian or archaeologist has used the Bible as trustworthy and agreed that He existed and died by crucifixion.

### 2. The Saints, Their Testimonials, and Their Miracles Are Inspiring

They are sometimes difficult to believe! The fact that they were real people, ready to die and be tortured, showed a genuine act of faith—that is, they really believed in what they preached. Considering the vast quantity of saints and their stories throughout all ages of time was quite overwhelming for me and has become convincing. Even if the miracles they performed don't convince you, their actions, way of life, and their impact on humankind cannot be questioned by believers or non-believers.

### 3. The Thought That Something Had to Start Somewhere

Atoms, materials, etc., all had an origin. So if we keep asking 'where did that come from?', it would naturally lead to a great super being—i.e., God. But what made God? Well, good question. Let's ask Him when we get to Heaven! No, but seriously, there are a few theologians who have tried to explain this. For me, I'm comfortable with the idea that **God transcends time and space**. So our feeble minds will not be able to comprehend the nature of God.

### 4. God Has Answered Prayers

And not just mine, but those of many others as well. There are some prayers I've requested, and God has sometimes chosen not to answer immediately. Sometimes He answers at a later time, and He answers in abundance. Sure, He doesn't always give me exactly what I wanted, but it's always what I needed. Reflecting on my prayer requests, He has always given me more than I could ever ask for. When terrible things happen, I believe all things are permitted to happen so that they can bring about a greater good. We may just not understand it and may never will.

### 5. The Resurrection

I would say **the biggest hurdle to believe in is the resurrection of Jesus**. Saint Paul says that without the resurrection, our faith is *useless* and we Christians are *the most pitiful of people* (1 Corinthians 15:12-19). I love listening to debates on this topic. A recent one is by the truly respected Trent Horn and Matt Dillahunty [3]. I've started to compile some points that made the resurrection convincing for me, but of course it's up to you to decide whether you'd like to seek this out further:

- **The Apostles endured horrendous deaths.** Many other groups often renounce their faith when faced with death or horrible torture. This indicates that the Apostles and early Christians really believed that Jesus truly resurrected.

- **Saint Paul's dramatic conversion.** He was formerly a Roman commander who publicly persecuted Christians and had a complete 180-degree conversion. This miraculous conversion, described in Acts 9:1-19, led Saint Paul to become one of Catholicism's greatest saints. What an amazing testimonial that one of Rome's high officials suddenly became one of Catholicism's biggest saints [5]. I cannot think of any other reason why Saint Paul would risk his high reputation, torture, and status other than if the conversion story was true.
