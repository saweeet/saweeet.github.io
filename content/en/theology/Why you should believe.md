For me, this has to be one of, if not the most important question someone can ever ask. We're talking not just about how we came to be, but also why we were made and whether there's life after death. For many, this will never be a priority to ponder; not unless some big life event occurs or death comes knocking on their door.

My personal reasoning for why I believe has changed progressively over the years and has evolved in many ways. I started as a cradle Catholic and was taught to believe at a very young age. However, like a majority of cradle Catholics, my faith was very watered down. I remember going to a YFC (Youth for Christ) camp and on Day 1, telling everyone that I was just there for the girls. What an embarrassment. However, from that camp I also saw that being Christian could be “cool”. I saw Christians break dancing, rapping, hip‑hopping, and singing praise and worship songs. Sure, it may have been a bit superficial, but it was a good start in realising that being Christian didn't have to mean being boring.

As life progressed, I exposed myself to more Catholic circles. Slowly my faith grew through friendships, music, testimonials, keynote speakers, Catholic radio, and podcasts. I started to connect the dots in my faith and find satisfying reasoning to the many objections outsiders would often challenge the Church with. I began to understand truths about my faith and how it would influence my everyday life. My life started to feel so free and is constantly filled with joy. My faith has taught me how to love my friends, family, and spouse in ways I would never have discovered otherwise.

So why should you believe in the Christian God?

## Initial Thoughts

- Why is God even important to us? Perhaps some of us don't want Him to be real since we may think all the “fun” will be out of reach.
- It's unlikely that there will be a single convincing answer to prove God's existence. Rather, it's likely a combination of reasons.
- God is immaterial, so we cannot use standard material science. This doesn't mean science and faith contradict; in fact, they should complement each other if both are pointing to truth.
- Acknowledge and be aware that we're all emotionally persuaded in one way or another. This includes examining our own biases and those of the people around us. Discern whether everyone is in a healthy mindset to critically think about the reasoning put forward from both parties.
- All other major religions have messengers from God; however, none claim to be God themselves. Jesus Christ is the only religious figure who claimed to be divine (see e.g. John 8:58; 10:30; Mark 2:5–7).
- Convincing evidence comes from people we trust, whether scholars, friends, or loved ones.
- The Bible is a reliable source of truth. The majority of reputable historians and archaeologists treat its historical core, especially the New Testament, as a serious, trustworthy source, even when they disagree on theology.[7][8]
- To be convinced is an individual journey. One must look for answers rather than expect to be forced to believe.
- As a Catholic, I believe the Devil is real, intelligent, and very much active. The Devil is doing everything possible to stop you, to make you believe that you're okay just by being a good person and that you'll get to go to a magical place after death.
- When discussing theology and God's existence, there will always be a “what if” question, a gap of the unknown that no amount of science would ever be able to prove. However, this doesn't mean we cannot be very strongly convinced. We look to probability or the best explanation of all the evidence, not mathematical certainty.

## Do I Think Religion Is Healthy?

I believe many of my friends would be open to the likelihood of God and even be convinced by many arguments. After all, the idea of a loving God who wants to grant you an abundance of gifts, virtues, love, and then eternity in paradise together with loved ones sounds very attractive.

As a Catholic, I believe that God created us to build a relationship with Him. At the root of all our desires, God alone can satisfy our hearts (cf. CCC 27–30). [file:15] Sadly, many will not pursue this idea due to social constructs, for example, the fear that Christian rules will limit their ability to have fun to the fullest, not wanting to be locked in, or even being outcasted from society. Consequently, these people will choose to turn a blind eye, hoping for an ignorant‑is‑bliss way of life. Whereas in reality, I found this to be the complete reverse: the truth made me feel more free and just so thankful for everything in life
