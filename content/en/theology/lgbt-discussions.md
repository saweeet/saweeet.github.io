# Quick thoughts
- This can be one of the most sensitive topics to talk about.
- We should never look down on anyone or make them feel they are less. Be sure to make everyone feel they are being respected.
- We should always approach this discussion with the highest level of love and humility.
- Understand that proclaiming our beliefs about LGBT issues is often received as hurtful.
- This doesn't mean we need to stay quiet about this topic.
- When engaging with this topic, it can really test our resolve in being Catholic. Of course, we don't want to hurt our friends or even lose them.
- We believe the LGBT lifestyle is harmful because it isn't ordered toward God's design.
- If things go against God's natural design, we will see negative effects. Natural design means the purpose of that thing.
- This negative effect is often confused and twisted.
