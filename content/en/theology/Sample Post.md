You can easily create tables using Markdown, with rows that support readability:

| this | is | a   | table | !
|------|---:|-----|-------|---
| this | is | the | 1st   | row
| this | is | the | 2nd   | row
| this | is | the | 3rd   | row
| edgy | jo | ke  | lands | here
| this | is | the | 5th   | row
| this | is | the | 6th   | row

Unordered lists render with high readabiltiy as well!

- Unordered list
  - First sub-item
  - Second sub-item
- Second top level item

As do ordered lists:

1. Top level
    1. First sub-level
        1. Second sub-level

Have fun writing with Markdown!
