Christians are called to evangelise our faith and set the world ablaze.

These page intends to help explain my understanding of my faith to myself, and to others of various topics including reasons of faith and morals. I’m no expert in any of the topics mentioned here, nor am I a theologian. These posts serves to help my understanding of my faith by putting them into writing. You are not going to find all the answers here. I might actually invoke more questions than answers. This is simply where I’m at with my level of understanding. 

In my posts, I divided my thoughts into two sections, initial thoughts and longer ones. Perhaps useful if I know I'm about to engage discussion. The longer ones for a deep dive.

Be sure to check out my **[Prayers](/prayers)** section if you're interested.

God bless and Peace out.
