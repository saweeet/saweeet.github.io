# Soba's Meal Routine

- **Feeding Times:** 7:30 AM and 5:30 PM each day.
- **Playtime:** 5â€“10 minutes before each meal.
- **Food:** Measure dry food (from the pantry) and wet food (from the fridge). Follow the measurements labelled on each container.
- **Scale:** Turn off the scale by holding the button on the right until it powers down. If it runs out of battery, you'll find batteries on the bottom drawer (same drawer as cling wrap and foil).

## Feeding Steps:

1. Say "Sit" to Soba.
2. Place the bowl on the stand. 
3. Hold Laksa back (she's not trained yet) while Soba waits.
4. If Soba tries to eat before your signal, gently block him with your arm and say "No" firmly.
5. Once he is sitting and making eye contact, say "Good boy" to signal he can start eating. 
6. Let Laksa eat too. 
7. They finish eating around the same time. Stop any attempts to eat from the other's bowl (they usually do this once they finish their own bowl). If all food is eaten, licking each other's empty bowls afterwards is fine.

# Discipline Guidelines

## No Biting Policy:
- If either cat bites (even gently), say "No" firmly, then leave them alone and ignore them for a few minutes.
- If a cat bites you while on you, say "No" firmly, place them down and ignore them.

## Kitchen Counter:
- If you see either cat on the benchtop or dining table, say "No" firmly. If they don't jump down, gently place them on the floor. Laksa is untrained and will gently need to be picked up and placed on the floor.
- Make sure no uncovered food or dirty dishes are left out. Place dirty dishes face down in the sink or directly into the dishwasher to avoid tempting him.
- If you're cooking or eating and Laksa keeps repeatedly jumping up on the benchtop or dining table, you can section her out of the kitchen by closing both sliding doors.

## Outdoor Safety:
- Soba and Laksa are an indoor-only cats.
- When entering, lead with your foot to prevent them from dashing outside.
- If returning home after a while, go to the kitchen first to give them a snack. Tell them to sit first before giving a snack to both of them. Laksa is getting better at sitting on command, but it's OK if she doesn't always get it since she's still learning. So long as Soba sits on command.
- Keep both front and back doors closed at all times.

# Handling Tips

- Pay attention to Soba and Laksa's body language to avoid bites (they bite very gently).
- Soba and Laksa enjoy face, forehead, neck, and under-chin scratches.
- He dislikes tummy and butt scratches.
- Soba loves being picked up and held.
- Laksa doesn't mind being picked up outside of her zoomies. She'll purr and usually will sit still, but can be a bit restless.

# Soba's Automatic Devices

- There's no need to handle the automatic litter box in the laundry room.
- The manual litter box in the living room will need scooping as usual.
- We will refill Soba's water fountain so it should be continuously flowing water. But if it's blinking and intermittently spurting out water, you can add more water on top.

# Bathroom

- Towels are found underneath the guest bathroom sink.
- Help yourself to toiletries found in the guest bathroom.

# Wi-Fi
- Name: Wi-Fries

# Desk and Monitor

- **Desk & Monitor Use:** Feel free to use the desk and monitor in the office.
- **Connecting Your Laptop:** There is a single black cable from the curved wide 34" monitor. Plug the USB-C cable from the Monitor directly into your laptop's USB-C port. Wait a few minutes, the screen should automatically display, and the mouse and keyboard should automatically work.

# TV Operation

## Fireplace TV
- **Short White Remote:** Use this to navigate the TV menu. The TV will start at volume 0, so you will need to pull the volume toggle button upwards for sound to hear.
## Dining Room TV:
- **Long Black Remote:** Use this to power the TV on/off and adjust the volume.

## TV Apps:
Use the Streamio or Prime app for movies and TV shows. Feel free to use YouTube as well.

# Aircon/heater & Fireplace Operation

- All bedrooms have aircon and heaters with their own remotes. Each white remote is kept on a table in their bedroom. If it's a hot day, you can leave them running on max with the doors open to cool the whole house. There is also a fan and air purifier in the music room.
- If you want to use the fireplace, there's an On/Off switch located on the right-hand side of the facade.
