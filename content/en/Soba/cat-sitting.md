# Arrival & Departure 

- **Arrive:** After 2pm, by 5:30 PM on Tuesday 21 January in time for Soba's dinner.
- **Leave:** Any time after Soba's breakfast on Thursday 23 January. An early breakfast is fine if you need to leave before 7:30 AM.
- **Keys:** When leaving on the final day, you can leave the keys on the kitchen benchtop. As you leave from the front door, just pull the front door shut so that the top gold lock clicks shut. The doorknob itself can be left unlocked.

1. Say "Sit" to Soba.

# Discipline Guidelines

## No Biting Policy:
- If Soba bites (even gently), say "No" firmly, then leave him alone and ignore him for a few minutes.
- If he bites while on you, say "No" firmly, place him down and ignore him.

## Kitchen Counter:
- If you see Soba on the counter, say "No" firmly. If he doesn't jump down, gently place him on the floor. 
- Make sure no uncovered food or dirty dishes are left out. Place dirty dishes face down in the sink or directly into the dishwasher to avoid tempting him.

## Outdoor Safety:
- Soba is an indoor-only cat.
- When entering, lead with your foot to prevent him from dashing outside.
- If returning home after a while, go to the kitchen first to give him a snack.
- Keep both front and back doors closed at all times.

# Handling Tips

- Pay attention to Soba's body language to avoid bites (he bites very gently).
- Soba enjoys face, forehead, neck, and under-chin scratches.
- He dislikes tummy and butt scratches.
- Soba loves being picked up and held.

---
# Soba's Automatic Devices

- Soba uses an automatic litter box, there's no need to handle any litter.
- We will refill Soba's water fountain so it should be continuously flowing water. But if it's blinking and intermittently spurting out water, you can add more water on top. 
- In emergencies if you're unable to make it to feed Soba, please contact us. We will activate the automatic feeder. If you're up to an hour late, it's fine to feed him as normal.

# Bathroom

- You're welcome to use our ensuite bathroom since the guest toilet is currently not installed.
- The guest bathroom's shower is a little weak, feel free to use our ensuite shower. 
- Towels are found underneath the guest bathroom sink.
- Help yourself to toiletries found in the guest bathroom.

# Desk and Monitor

- **Desk & Monitor Use:** Feel free to use the desk and monitor in the office.
- **Connecting Your Laptop:** There is a single black cable from the wide 34" monitor. Plug the USB-C cable from the Monitor directly into your laptop's USB-C port. Wait a few minutes, the screen should automatically display, and the mouse and keyboard should automatically work.

# TV Operation


## Fireplace TV
**Short Remote:** Use this to navigate the TV menu. The TV will start at volume 0, so you will need to pull the volume toggle button upwards for sound to hear.
## Dining Room TV:
- **Long Remote:** Use this to power the TV on/off and adjust the volume.

## TV Apps:
Unfortunately, we don't have Netflix. Instead, use the Steamio or Prime app for movies and TV shows. Feel free to use YouTube as well.

# Aircon & Fireplace Operation

- 3 of the 4 bedrooms have aircon with their own remotes. Each white remote is kept on a table in their bedroom. If it's a hot day, you can leave them running on max with the doors open to cool the whole house. Feel free to leave aircon running at night from the study to your guest bedroom to stay cool. There is also a fan in the guest bedroom to help with airflow.
- If you want to use the fireplace, there's an On/Off switch located on the right-hand side of the facade.
