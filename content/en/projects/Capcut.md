**Unlocking Premium Features on CapCut for Free**

A few months ago, I stumbled upon an older version of CapCut that seems to work seamlessly without requiring payment for many premium features. This discovery came from a Reddit post that provided a simple workaround. Here’s the original Reddit post for reference: [CapCut Cracked for Laptop and Mobile](https://www.reddit.com/r/CapCut/comments/1gndiet/capcut_cracked_for_laptop_and_mobile/?share_id=S4oKMWaF_Bxwv7Ok60fD-&utm_content=2&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_source=share&utm_term=1).

### The Direct Link

For convenience, the direct download link from **@luigkilly’s** Google Drive is here: [Download CapCut Cracked Version](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Jx03ymWm02KF8llUvPIeKz9oIyn-MeLs/view?usp=drivesdk).

### How to Use It

1. **Download the File:** Use the link above to download the APK file onto your device.
    
2. **Install It:** Find the downloaded APK file on your mobile phone and open it. In android, there should be a native built-in app called `Files`.  After opening the file, this should begin installation process. You may need to allow installation from unknown sources.
    
3. **Start Editing:** Open the app and enjoy.
