# Quick hints and checklist when House Inspecting

- Have a numbered bullet point list of items that are essential and priority to you. 
- After visiting the property, score it on a table against each of the essentials items for you. e.g.
  
  | House URL                        | Location         | Essential Item 1 (Quiet) | Essential Item 2 (Sunlight) | Essential Item 3 (Distance to Harkaway College) | Total Score |
