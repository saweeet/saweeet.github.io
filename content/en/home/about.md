### Hey!

I'm Jeremy, a devout Catholic and husband to the most beautiful wife.

This site serves as a space for a variety of content that I'm interested in and passionate about. I use it as a playground for many of the technologies I enjoy tinkering with. I expect this site to undergo some wear and tear, be pulled apart, and then revived every so often.

I tinker on stuff like this, I play classical guitar, a bit of a chessbrah fan, cat trainer, strategy computer games, getting outside, inspiring cook.
