# Arrival & Departure 

**Deb and Janik**
- Arrive Monday, 29 September any time before 5:30pm in time for the cats' dinner.
- Leave Thursday, 9 October any time after 5:30pm dinner.

**Lawrence**
- Arrive in time for Friday, 10 October breakfast at 7:30am.
- Leave any time after Tuesday, 21 October 5:30pm dinner. We return Wednesday, 22 October around 7am—you are welcome to stay longer after we arrive.

**Front door entering/leaving**
- When entering, lead with a front foot to deter cats from being tempted to go outside. Once inside, close the door behind you and head directly to the kitchen area to provide them a snack (Greenies). This teaches the cats to expect a treat as soon as someone arrives (and also deters them from squeezing out the front door).
- Keep external doors closed as we want to discourage cats from running outside. If having guests over, see our [Having Guests over](./cat-sitting/#having-guests-over) section below.
- If you need to leave the front door open for long periods, place the cats in the kitchen area with both sliding doors closed. For example, until all guests have arrived or when you need to bring in lots of shopping/groceries.
- For the front screen door, you may leave it unlocked.

**Keys and security:**
1. Wake the keypad by touching it.
2. Enter your PIN: type the 4–12 digit PIN when all buttons are visible.
3. Press the [*] button to complete—the door will unlock if the PIN is correct.

# Soba and Laksa's Meal Routine

- **Feeding Times:** 7:30am and 5:30pm each day.
- **Playtime** (optional): 5–10 minutes before each meal.
- **Food:** Measure dry food (from the pantry) and wet food (from the fridge). Follow the measurements labeled on the dry container.
- **Scale:** Turn off the scale by pressing **tare** (the button to make it zero) twice. If it runs out of battery, you'll find batteries in the bottom drawer (same drawer as cling wrap and foil).

## Feeding Steps
1. Bring both bowls of food to the feeding area.
2. Say "Sit" once. Avoid repeating the command.
3. Look at Soba and wait for him to sit. Look at Laksa and wait for her to sit (or stand).
4. As soon as they both sit at the same time, place the bowls down. Laksa eats from the left bowl, Soba eats from the right bowl.
5. Block Laksa (she's not trained yet) while Soba sits and waits.
6. If Soba tries to eat before your signal, gently block him with your arm and say "No" firmly.
7. Once he is sitting and making eye contact, say "Good boy/job" to signal he can start eating.  **Hint:** I use my left hand to block Laksa while I look at Soba and wait for him to make eye contact.
8. Let Laksa eat too.
9. Stop any attempts to eat from each other's bowl (Soba may do this). If all food is eaten, licking each other's empty bowls afterward is fine.

# Cat 101 & Discipline Guidelines

## No Biting Policy
- If either cat bites (even gently), say "No" firmly, then leave them alone and ignore them for a few minutes.
- If a cat bites you while on you, say "No" firmly, place them down, and ignore them.

## Kitchen Counter
- If you see either cat on the benchtop or dining table, say "No" firmly. If they don't jump down, gently place them on the floor. Laksa is untrained and will need to be gently picked up and placed on the floor.
- Make sure no uncovered food or dirty dishes are left out. Place dirty dishes face down in the sink or directly into the dishwasher to avoid tempting them.
- If you're cooking or eating and either Soba or Laksa keeps repeatedly jumping up on the benchtop or dining table, you may move them out of the kitchen by closing both sliding doors.

## Outdoor Safety
- Soba and Laksa are indoor-only cats.
- When entering, lead with your foot to prevent them from dashing outside.
- If returning home after a while, go to the kitchen first to give them a snack. Tell them to sit first before giving a snack to both of them.
- Keep both front and back doors closed at all times.

## Handling Tips

**Soba**
- Soba enjoys face, forehead, neck, and under-chin scratches.
- Soba loves being picked up and held.
- He dislikes tummy scratches.
- Pay attention to body language to avoid bites. See the [cat language cheatsheet](./cat-sitting/#cat-language-cheatsheet) section to help understand.

**Laksa**
- Laksa loves to play, especially with wand toys.
- Laksa likes butt scratches (the arch between her tail and back).
- Pay attention to Laksa's body language to avoid bites. See the [cat language cheatsheet](./cat-sitting/#cat-language-cheatsheet) section to help understand.
- She can be a bit restless when being picked up. If she is wriggling to get out of your arms, slowly place her down. Avoid letting Laksa jump out of your arms. This will teach Laksa to wait to be put down.

## Picking up a cat

There are two ways to pick up a cat. Whichever way, key is that the cat feels supported. Support the chest and back legs. 

**Method 1:**
1. Scoop from under the chest
2. Support the back legs keep the cat close to the body so it feels secure.
3. To help them feel more secure, keep the cat horizontal level like (-) and less angled like ( \ ).
 or ( ~ )
See https://www.youtube.com/shorts/N2oAwgx5mCg to see how this is done. 

**Method 2:**
1. Hand under armpit
2. Other hand under belly
3. Armpit side put over shoulder

## Don'ts
- Don't play with your hands or fingers. Use a wand or toy instead. The reason behind this is that we don't want to encourage biting, even playful or gentle bites.
- Do not continue to give them attention (petting or playing with them) if they do something incorrect (going on top of a benchtop, any kind of bites, etc.).
- Follow them around if cats try to escape. Always make sure they have a place to escape and are not cornered in. 

## Do's
- Please do send some videos of them each day, even they're just lazying around.
