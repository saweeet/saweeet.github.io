# Arrival & Departure 

**Deb and Janik:**
- Arrive Monday 29 September any time before 5.30pm in time for the cats' dinner.
- Leave Thursday 9 October any time after 5.30pm dinner

**Lawrence:** 
- Arrive in time for Friday 10 October breakfast at 7.30am
- Leave any time after Tuesday 21 October 5.30pm dinner. We return Wednesday 22 October around 7am, you are welcome to stay longer, after we arrive
  
**Front door entering/leaving:**
- When entering, lead with a front foot to deter cats being tempted to go outside. Once entered, close the door behind and head directly to the kitchen area and provide them a snack (greenies). This is to teaach cats to expect a treat as soon as someone arrives (also deters them from the front door).
- Avoid having the door open for long periods, as we want to discourage cats from running outside. If having guests over, lookout for cats being tempted to run out. 
- If needing to leave the front door for logn periods, place cats in the kitchen area with doors closed. For example, until all guests arrived or need to bring lots of shopping/groceries in.
- For the front door, leave the screen door unlocked. Keys and security:
1. Wake the keypad by touching the keypad
2. Enter your Pin: type the 4–12 digit PIN when all buttons are visible.
3. Press the [*] button to complete and the door will unlock if the PIN is correct.

# Soba and Laksa's Meal Routine

- **Feeding Times:** 7:30 AM and 5:30 PM each day.
- **Playtime:** 5–10 minutes before each meal.
- **Food:** Measure dry food (from the pantry) and wet food (from the fridge). Follow the measurements labelled on each container.
- **Scale:** Turn off the scale by pressing tar (the button to make it zero) twice. If it runs out of battery, you'll find batteries on the bottom drawer (same drawer as cling wrap and foil).

## Feeding Steps:

1. Bring both bowls of food to the feeding area. 
2. Say "Sit" once. Avoid repeating saying sit.
3. Look at Soba and for him to Sit. Look at Laksa wait for her to sit (or stand) 
5. As soon as they both sit at the same time, place the bowls down. Laksa tends to eat from the left bowl. Soba likes to eat from the right bowl.
6. Hold Laksa back (she's not trained yet) while Soba waits. 
7. If Soba tries to eat before your signal, gently block him with your arm and say "No" firmly.
8. Once he is sitting and making eye contact, say "Good boy" to signal he can start eating. Hint: I use my left hand to block Laksa, while I look at Soba and wait for him to make eye contact.
9. Let Laksa eat too. 
10. They finish eating around the same time. Stop any attempts to eat from the other's bowl (they usually do this once they finish their own bowl). If all food is eaten, licking each other's empty bowls afterwards is fine.

# Cat 101 & Discipline Guidelines

## No Biting Policy:
- If either cat bites (even gently), say "No" firmly, then leave them alone and ignore them for a few minutes.
- If a cat bites you while on you, say "No" firmly, place them down and ignore them.

## Kitchen Counter:
- If you see either cat on the benchtop or dining table, say "No" firmly. If they don't jump down, gently place them on the floor. Laksa is untrained and will gently need to be picked up and placed on the floor.
- Make sure no uncovered food or dirty dishes are left out. Place dirty dishes face down in the sink or directly into the dishwasher to avoid tempting him.
- If you're cooking or eating and either Soba or Laksa keeps repeatedly jumping up on the benchtop or dining table, you may move them out of the kitchen by closing both sliding doors.

## Outdoor Safety:
- Soba and Laksa are an indoor-only cats.
- When entering, lead with your foot to prevent them from dashing outside.
- If returning home after a while, go to the kitchen first to give them a snack. Tell them to sit first before giving a snack to both of them. Laksa is getting better at sitting on command, but it's OK if she doesn't always get it since she's still learning. So long as Soba sits on command.
- Keep both front and back doors closed at all times.

## Handling Tips

- Pay attention to Soba and Laksa's body language to avoid bites (they bite very gently).
- Soba and Laksa enjoy face, forehead, neck, and under-chin scratches.
- He dislikes tummy and butt scratches.
- Soba loves being picked up and held.
- Laksa doesn't mind being picked up outside of her zoomies. She'll purr and usually will sit still, but can be a bit restless.

## Picking up a cat

There are two ways to pick up a cat. Whichever way, key is that the cat feels supported. Support the chest and back legs. 

**Method 1:**
1. Scoop from under the chest
2. Support the back legs keep the cat close to the body so it feels secure.
3. To help them feel more secure, keep the cat horizontal level like (-) and less angled like (\).

See https://www.youtube.com/shorts/N2oAwgx5mCg to see how this is done. 

**Method 2:**
1. Hand under armpit
2. Other hand under belly
3. Armpit side put over shoulder

## Dont's
- Play with your hand or fingers. Use a wand or toy instead. The reason behind this is that we don't want to encourage biting, even playful or gentle bites.
- Continue to give them attention (petting or playing with them), if they do something incorrect (going ontop of a benchtop, any kind of bites, etc)

# Soba's Automatic Devices

- There's no need to handle the automatic litter box in the laundry room.
- The manual litter box in the living room will need scooping as usual.
- We will refill Soba's water fountain so it should be continuously flowing water. But if it's blinking and intermittently spurting out water, you can add more water on top.
