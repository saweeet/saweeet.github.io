Day 1 in Rome,
Gosh. What a day. We had 24 hours of flying and the flying part wasn't all that bad. Perhaps because I was with my best friend, and although we didnt say much, we could cuddle and make each other laugh here and there. This cut that trip down into half. I watched 3 movies, I tried to watch ones with Italy, Greece or Paris related. Any musketeer movie is always a favourite. ðŸ™‚ 

Tip no. 1: Travel with a friend(s).
We checked into our apartment Al-7 . Turns out, the lady running the joint is also filipino. Her tagalog was way too fast for us but we struggled to mutter a few tagalog words back, hinting that we can't really speak tagalog so please be gentle with us. Our check in was suppose to be in the afternoon, but we rocked up early in the off chance that they would let us in early. They did. Our little gamble paid off. It was good, coz I needed to use the bathroom. She also informed us, there was some city tax involved in each city. We were confused since our receipt said 'all taxes included', so we thought this filipino chick is trying to take advantage of us! But, we double checked our booking and she was right, there was some missing city tax that needed to be paid off. 

Tip no . 2: check for city taxes! Rome was EURO$3.50 per person / per night. 
We quickly settled in, and got ourselves comfortable at the hotel. Soon we ventured out into the city. It was a tiny bit like Melbourne. It was cold and windy one minute, then the other it was super hot! Against our will, we decided to bring a back pack even though we know we be potrayed as tourist and attract pick pocketers. 

Tip no. 3: Even your asian, goodluck trying not to look like a tourist. Bring or wear a blazer ? 
We walked to the Basicalla of Saint Maria of Traverese? .  Beauitful high altar. It was really special.
After this, we crashed back at the hotel.
