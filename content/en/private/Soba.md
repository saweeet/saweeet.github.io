## Discipline Guidelines

### No Biting Policy:
- If Soba bites (even gently), say "No" firmly, then leave him alone and ignore him for a few minutes.
- If he bites while on you, say "No" firmly, place him down and ignore him.

### Kitchen Counter:
- If you see Soba on the counter, say "No" firmly. If he doesn't jump down, gently place him on the floor. 
- Make sure no uncovered food or dirty dishes are left out. Place dirty dishes face down in the sink or directly into the dishwasher to avoid tempting him.

### Outdoor Safety:
- Soba is an indoor-only cat.
- When entering, lead with your foot to prevent him from dashing outside.
- If returning home after a while, go to the kitchen first to give him a snack.
- Keep both front and back doors closed at all times.

# Handling Tips

- Pay attention to Soba's body language to avoid bites (he bites very gently).
- Soba enjoys face, forehead, neck, and under-chin scratches.
- He dislikes tummy and butt scratches.
- Soba loves being picked up and held.

---
## Soba's automatic devices

- Soba uses an automatic litter box, there's no need to handle any litter.
- We will refill Soba's water fountain so it should be continuously flowing water. But if it's blinking and intermittently spurting out water, you can add more water on top. 
- In emergencies if you're unable to make it to feed Soba, please contact us. We will activate the automatic feeder. If you're up to an hour late, it's fine to feed him as normal.

## Aircon & Fireplace Operation

If it's a hot day, you can leave them running on max with the doors open to cool the whole house. Feel free to leave aircon running at night from the study to your guest bedroom to stay cool. There is also a fan in the guest bedroom to help with airflow.
