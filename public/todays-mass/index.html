<blockquote>
<p>Naaman went down and plunged into the Jordan seven times at the word of Elisha, the man of God. His flesh became again like the flesh of a little child, and he was clean of his leprosy.</p>
<p>Naaman returned with his whole retinue to the man of God. On his arrival he stood before Elisha and said, &ldquo;Now I know that there is no God in all the earth, except in Israel. Please accept a gift from your servant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elisha replied, &ldquo;As the LORD lives whom I serve, I will not take it;&rdquo; and despite Naaman&rsquo;s urging, he still refused.</p>
<p>Naaman said: &ldquo;If you will not accept, please let me, your servant, have two mule-loads of earth, for I will no longer offer holocaust or sacrifice to any other god except to the LORD.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Beloved: Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, a descendant of David: such is my gospel, for which I am suffering, even to the point of chains, like a criminal. But the word of God is not chained. Therefore, I bear with everything for the sake of those who are chosen, so that they too may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus, together with eternal glory. This saying is trustworthy:</p>
<p>If we have died with him we shall also live with him; if we persevere we shall also reign with him. But if we deny him he will deny us. If we are unfaithful he remains faithful, for he cannot deny himself.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Gospel Reading (Luke 17:11-19):</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>As Jesus continued his journey to Jerusalem, he traveled through Samaria and Galilee. As he was entering a village, ten lepers met him. They stood at a distance from him and raised their voices, saying, &ldquo;Jesus, Master! Have pity on us!&rdquo; And when he saw them, he said, &ldquo;Go show yourselves to the priests.&rdquo; As they were going they were cleansed. And one of them, realizing he had been healed, returned, glorifying God in a loud voice; and he fell at the feet of Jesus and thanked him. He was a Samaritan. Jesus said in reply, &ldquo;Ten were cleansed, were they not? Where are the other nine? Has none but this foreigner returned to give thanks to God?&rdquo; Then he said to him, &ldquo;Stand up and go; your faith has saved you.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<h3 id="-profession-of-faith-creed" class="anchor-link"><a href="#-profession-of-faith-creed"><strong>[STAND]</strong> Profession of Faith (Creed)</a></h3>
<p><strong>All:</strong> I believe in one God, the Father almighty, maker of heaven and earth, of all things visible and invisible. I believe in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Only Begotten Son of God, born of the Father before all ages. God from God, Light from Light, true God from true God, begotten, not made, consubstantial with the Father; through him all things were made. For us men and for our salvation he came down from heaven, <em>(all bow)</em> and by the Holy Spirit was incarnate of the Virgin Mary, and became man. For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate, he suffered death and was buried, and rose again on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures. He ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father. He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead and his kingdom will have no end. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life, who proceeds from the Father and the Son, who with the Father and the Son is adored and glorified, who has spoken through the prophets. I believe in one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church. I confess one Baptism for the forgiveness of sins and I look forward to the resurrection of the dead and the life of the world to come. Amen.</p>

<p><strong>Priest:</strong> You are indeed Holy, O Lord, the fount of all holiness.</p>
<p>Make holy, therefore, these gifts, we pray, by sending down your Spirit upon them like the dewfall, so that they may become for us the Body and Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>At the time he was betrayed and entered willingly into his Passion, he took bread and, giving thanks, broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying:</p>
<p><strong>TAKE THIS, ALL OF YOU, AND EAT OF IT, FOR THIS IS MY BODY, WHICH WILL BE GIVEN UP FOR YOU.</strong></p>
<p>In a similar way, when supper was ended, he took the chalice and, once more giving thanks, he gave it to his disciples, saying:</p>
<p><strong>TAKE THIS, ALL OF YOU, AND DRINK FROM IT, FOR THIS IS THE CHALICE OF MY BLOOD, THE BLOOD OF THE NEW AND ETERNAL COVENANT, WHICH WILL BE POURED OUT FOR YOU AND FOR MANY FOR THE FORGIVENESS OF SINS. DO THIS IN MEMORY OF ME.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Priest:</strong> The mystery of faith.<br>
<strong>All:</strong> We proclaim your Death, O Lord, and profess your Resurrection until you come again.<br>
<em>Or:</em> When we eat this Bread and drink this Cup, we proclaim your Death, O Lord, until you come again.<br>
<em>Or:</em> Save us, Saviour of the world, for by your Cross and Resurrection you have set us free.</p>
<p><strong>Priest:</strong> Therefore, as we celebrate the memorial of his Death and Resurrection, we offer you, Lord, the Bread of life and the Chalice of salvation, giving thanks that you have held us worthy to be in your presence and minister to you.</p>
<p>Humbly we pray that, partaking of the Body and Blood of Christ, we may be gathered into one by the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Remember, Lord, your Church, spread throughout the world, and bring her to the fullness of charity, together with N. our Pope and N. our Bishop and all the clergy.</p>
<p>Remember also our brothers and sisters who have fallen asleep in the hope of the resurrection, and all who have died in your mercy: welcome them into the light of your face.</p>
<p>Have mercy on us all, we pray, that with the Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God, with blessed Joseph, her Spouse, with the blessed Apostles, and all the Saints who have pleased you throughout the ages, we may merit to be coheirs to eternal life, and may praise and glorify you through your Son, Jesus Christ.</p>
