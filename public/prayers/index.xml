      <description>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;1. The Resurrection of Jesus Christ&#xD;&#xA;2. The Ascension of Jesus to Heaven&#xD;&#xA;3. The Descent of the Holy Ghost&#xD;&#xA;4. The Assumption of Mary into Heaven&#xD;&#xA;5. Mary is Crowned as Queen of Heaven and Earth&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;1st-glorious-mystery-the-resurrection-of-jesus-christ&#34; class=&#34;anchor-link&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#1st-glorious-mystery-the-resurrection-of-jesus-christ&#34;&gt;1st Glorious Mystery: The Resurrection of Jesus Christ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At dawn of the first day of the week, I was with John and Peter. I was in my room alone: John and Peter were in the next room. I woke up. There was a light: it was all over the room. There was my Son: He came forward, He said to me, &amp;ldquo;Come, for you are the one worthy to be the first to see My risen body.&amp;rdquo; The Lord permitted me to kiss His hand and to be embraced. The Lord in His glorified body in which He had the scars of the nail prints in His hands and feet and the scar of the lance in His side, was no longer the bleeding Son I saw on the way to Calvary: His body was full of light, a light that was emanating from His body. Jesus then said to me , &amp;ldquo;Do not, My mother, tell My disciples until I have sent Mary Magdelene because it is all in the plan of the Father. They will come to faith by seeing and touching. I have come to you because you have faith. Pray that My disciples will accept Me risen from the dead.&amp;rdquo; Then He went away to appear to Mary Magdelene, to the women, and then to His disciples.&#xA;My children, the most precious gift you have is your faith. Your faith must not be hidden: your faith must be your main motivation in your life. Cast away all doubt by prayer: give yourselves totally to Jesus Who will illuminate your mind and heart through the power of the resurrection.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;1.  The Annunciation of the Lord to Mary&#xD;&#xA;2.  The Visitation of Mary to Elizabeth&#xD;&#xA;3.  The Nativity of our Lord Jesus Christ&#xD;&#xA;4.  The Presentation of our Lord&#xD;&#xA;5.  Finding Jesus in the Temple at age 12&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;1st-joyful-mystery-the-annunciation-of-the-lord-to-mary&#34; class=&#34;anchor-link&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#1st-joyful-mystery-the-annunciation-of-the-lord-to-mary&#34;&gt;1st Joyful Mystery: The Annunciation of the Lord to Mary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was in prayer: it was evening. I was praying towards Jerusalem because my people prayed three times a day, morning, noon, and evening facing Jerusalem. I was praying for the Liberation of my people. I was praying that soon the Messiah would come to take away all hatred: to take away all sins from my people. As I was praying, there suddenly appeared an angel. At first I was afraid because it was the first time an angel had ever come to me. When I heard him say &amp;ldquo;Hail, full of grace, the Lord is with you&amp;rdquo; I was very confused at this greeting and yet I was very humbled that an angel would call me full of grace: that I had gained favor from God: that I was called to bear His Son. I asked the angel how this could happen? I am a virgin: I had intended to be a virgin the rest of my life even though I agreed to live with Joseph. The angel assured me, &amp;ldquo;The Holy Spirit will come upon you: the shadow of the Most High will enwrap you and the child to be born of you will be called Son of God.&amp;rdquo; At that instance, I remembered the prophesy of Isaiah. The prophesy of the Messiah. The prophesy that He would be a suffering servant. A servant rejected by His own people and yet raised by God. Knowing that, I said, &amp;ldquo;Behold the handmaid, the servant of the Lord: be it done to me according to Your word.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;1. The Baptism in the Jordan&#xD;&#xA;2. The Wedding at Cana&#xD;&#xA;3. The Proclamation of the Kingdom&#xD;&#xA;4. The Transfiguration&#xD;&#xA;5.

The Baptism in the Jordan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;John is baptizing in the Jordan proclaiming a baptism of repentance.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;I am the voice of one crying in the desert, make straight the way of the Lord.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;One mightier than I is coming after me.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;I have baptized you with water, He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Seeing Jesus, John exclaims: &amp;ldquo;Behold the Lamb of God.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;After Jesus&amp;rsquo; baptism a voice from Heaven: &amp;ldquo;This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The Spirit descends upon Jesus in the form of a dove.&#xA;In this heavenly manifestation is instituted the sacrament of baptism.&#xA;The divine Trinity is manifested: the voice of the Father is heard as the Spirit descends upon the Son.&#xA;Filled with the Holy Spirit, Jesus was led by the Spirit into the desert for 40 days.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;1. The Agony of Jesus in the Garden&#xD;&#xA;2. The Scourging at the Pillar&#xD;&#xA;3. Jesus is Crowned with Thorns&#xD;&#xA;4. Jesus Carried the Cross&#xD;&#xA;5. The Crucifixion of our Lord&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;1st-sorrowful-mystery-the-agony-of-jesus-in-the-garden&#34; class=&#34;anchor-link&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#1st-sorrowful-mystery-the-agony-of-jesus-in-the-garden&#34;&gt;1st Sorrowful Mystery: The Agony of Jesus in the Garden&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My Son came with His apostles to the mount of Olives. There was a garden there that He frequently went to pray: He felt a sadness; a deep, deep sadness. He felt lonely: my Son in His humanity felt a deeper sadness than anyone could ever feel because He was pure of heart: He was sinless. He took His closest friends, Peter whom He was to give charge of the Church, James, and John. John was the one who was going to take care of me after Jesus had risen from the dead. Jesus said to them: My heart is sorrowful to the point of death: stay here and pray and keep watch while I go and pray by Myself.&amp;quot; Jesus went over further to pray: He wanted to pray by Himself. He wanted to pour out His heart to His Father as I often have seen Him do with His prayer. My Son always prayed continuously to His Father: He always looked to the Father for His consolation. During the time He prayed, He saw all the agony He was going to suffer: and the agony was not so much the pain of the crucifixion as the pains of the sins of the world. Every sin, every injustice, every infidelity He saw and felt at that very moment, caused Him to sweat blood. His agony, His sorrow, and so much sinfulness caused the blood to burst from His forehead. It was just another anticipation of when His Precious Blood would be shed on the cross. That Blood that was sweat on Gethsemane blessed that very spot into Jesus&amp;rsquo; sacred place of prayer.&#xA;My children, never seek your comfort in anyone but God. In your times of loneliness, in your times of depression, in your times of doubt, have recourse to prayer. When you go to the Father, offer this mystery for those who are in doubt: those who do not know where to turn to: those who are depressed: the mentally ill: the emotionally ill. Pray that as the Father sent an angel to comfort my Son, the Lord in His mercy will comfort them and enlighten them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Angelus has been traditionally said three times daily, at 6 am, noon and 6 pm&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;V. The Angel of the Lord declared unto Mary,&#xA;&lt;em&gt;R. And she conceived of the Holy Spirit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hail Mary, etc&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;V. Behold the handmaid of the Lord.&#xA;&lt;em&gt;R. Be it done unto me according to Your Word.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hail Mary, etc&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;V. And the Word was made flesh,&#xA;(all bow or genuflect as these words are spoken)&#xA;&lt;em&gt;R. And dwelt among us.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The first set of petitions in the Litany of Humility requests our deliverance from desiring validation from man instead of God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;O Jesus! meek and humble of heart, Hear me.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Response for the following: Deliver me, Jesus.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;From the desire of being esteemed …&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;From the desire of being loved …&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;From the desire of being extolled …&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;From the desire of being honored …&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;From the desire of being praised …&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;From the desire of being preferred to others…&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;From the desire of being consulted …&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;From the desire of being approved …&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The second set of petitions address our fears that are related to pride.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Remember O Most Gracious Virgin Mary, that never was it known that anyone who fled unto Thy protection, implored Thy help or sought Thine intercession, was left unaided by Thee. Inspired by this confidence I fly onto Thee, O Virgin of virgins, my Mother. To Thee I come, before Thee I stand, sinful and sorrowful. Do not, O Mother of the Word Incarnate, despise my petitions but, in Thy clemency, hear and answer me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Night Prayers to Say at Bedtime</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Taken directly from Jeannie Myers - &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.biblestudytools.com/bible-study/topical-studies/calming-prayers-to-say-before-bed.html&#34;&gt;https://www.biblestudytools.com/bible-study/topical-studies/calming-prayers-to-say-before-bed.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bedtime prayer can be a meaningful way to spend time with God every evening, talking over your day, sharing your concerns with Him, and thanking Him for His love and care. But why should we take time to pray before bed each night?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Praying as you fall asleep gives you the chance to look back over the day and thank God for His help and His blessings. We often miss the hand of God in our lives as we run from one activity to another. We lose sight of the good gifts our heavenly Father is giving us (James 1:17) and focus instead on our troubles and worries.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I give you heartfelt thanks for all the love and goodness you show them.

Continue to watch over them. Provide for all their needs of body and soul. Pray, likewise, for me, for my husband, and my whole family, that we may all one day rejoice in your blessed company.&#xA;Amen&lt;/p&gt;</description>
