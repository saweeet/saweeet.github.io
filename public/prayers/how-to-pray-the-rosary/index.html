<h1 id="how-to-pray-the-rosary" class="anchor-link"><a href="#how-to-pray-the-rosary">How to pray the Rosary</a></h1>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Begin by holding the crucifix, saying &ldquo;In the Name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,&rdquo; (making the sign of the Cross while doing that), then say the Apostles Creed.</li>
</ol></blockquote>
<p>In the name of the Father of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Amen</p>
<p><strong>The Apostles&rsquo; Creed:</strong> I believe in God the Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth; and in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord; Who was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died and was buried. He descended into hell. On the third day He arose again; He ascended into heaven,and sitteth at the right hand of God, the Father Almighty; from thence He shall come to judge the living and the dead. I believe in the Holy Ghost, the Holy Catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgivness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting. Amen</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>On the single bead just above the cross, pray the &ldquo;Our Father.&rdquo;</li>
</ol></blockquote>
<p>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name: Thy kingdom come: Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread: and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation: but deliver us from evil. Amen.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>The &ldquo;Hail Mary&rdquo; prayer is said on the next three beads, while meditating on the three divine virtues of faith, hope, and love/charity.</li>
</ol></blockquote>
<p>Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="4">
<li>On the chain or cord after the three beads, say the &ldquo;Glory be&hellip;&rdquo;</li>
</ol></blockquote>
<p>Glory be to the Father, and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit.  As it was in the beginning, is now and ever shall be, world without end.  Amen.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>On the next bead, which is a single bead, you announce the first divine mystery of contemplation. For example, if it were a Monday, you would say the first Joyful Mystery is &ldquo;The Annunciation&rdquo;, at this point you pray the &ldquo;Our Father&rdquo; prayer.
2.  You will now come to the second decade or group of 10 beads, you will now pray the 10 Hail Marys while contemplating the appropriate mystery.
3.  You continue to pray the rosary the same way throughout. If your intention is to pray a Chaplet (a single set of mysteries) at the end of the fifth mystery you will come back to the joiner, this is where the decades all join with the lower part of the rosary which contains the cross. When you come to the joiner, you decide whether or not you wish to say another Chaplet or end. If you decide to say another Chaplet you simply announce the next mystery and continue.
4. If you wish to end, you simply say the Glory Be To The Father, the O My Jesus, The Our Father and end the rosary with the Hail Holy Queen and the sign of the Cross</li>
</ol></blockquote>
<p><strong>The Fatima Prayer:</strong> &ldquo;O my Jesus, forgive us our sins, save us from the fires of hell, and lead all souls to Heaven, especially those in most need of Your Mercy&rdquo;.</p>
<p><strong>The Hail, Holy Queen:</strong> Hail, holy Queen, Mother of Mercy! our life, our sweetness, and our hope! To thee do we cry, poor banished children of Eve; to thee do we send up our sighs, mourning and weeping in this valley, of tears. Turn, then, most gracious Advocate, thine eyes of mercy toward us; and after this our exile show unto us the blessed fruit of thy womb, Jesus; O clement, O loving, O sweet Virgin Mary.
Pray for us, O holy Mother of God. That we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ.</p>
<p>O God, whose only-begotten Son, by His life, death, and resurrection, has purchased for us the rewards of eternal salvation; grant we beseech Thee, that meditating upon these mysteries of the most holy Rosary of the Blessed Virgin Mary, we may imitate what they contain and obtain what they promise. Through the same Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>
