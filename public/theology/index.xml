      <title>Why you should believe</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For me, this has to be one of, if not the most important question someone can ever ask. We&amp;rsquo;re talking not just about how we came to be, but also why we were made and if there&amp;rsquo;s a life after death. For many, this will never be a priority to ponder, not unless death comes knocking on their doors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My personal reasoning as to why I believe has changed progressively over the years and has evolved in many ways. I started as a cradle Catholic, so I was taught to believe at a very young age. However, like a majority of cradle Catholics, my faith was very watered down. I remember going to an YFC (Youth for Christ) camp and on Day-1, telling everyone that I was just there for the girls. What an embarrassment. However, from that camp I saw that being Christian could be &amp;lsquo;cool&amp;rsquo;. I saw Christians Break dancing, rapping, hip hopping, and also singing to Praise and Worship. Sure, it may have been a bit superficial, but it was a good start in knowing that Christians doesnt need to mean boring. As life progressed, I exposed myself to more Catholic circles. Slowly my faith grew through friendships, music, testimonials, keynote speakers, Catholic radio, and podcasts. I started to connected dots in faith and understanding. I began to understand truths about my faith and how it would influence my everyday life. My life started to feel so free and is constantly filled with joy. My faith has taught me how to love my friends, family, and spouse in ways I would never have found otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to navigate LGBT discussions</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;quick-thoughts&#34; class=&#34;anchor-link&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#quick-thoughts&#34;&gt;Quick thoughts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This can be the most sensitive topic to talk about.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;We should never look down or make anyone feel they are less. Be sure to make everyone feel they&amp;rsquo;re are being respected.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;We should always approach this discussion with highest level of love and humility.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Understand that proclaiming our beliefs around LGBT is often received as hurtful.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean we need to stay quiet about this topic&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;When engaging with this topic, it can really test your resolve of being Catholic. I mean, of course we don&amp;rsquo;t want to hurt our friends, or even lose them.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;We believe LGBT lifestyle is harmful because it isn&amp;rsquo;t ordered towards Gods design.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If things go against Gods natural design, we will see a negative effect. Natural design, meaning the purpose of that thing.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This negative effect is often confused and twisted, and so&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;longer-ones&#34; class=&#34;anchor-link&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#longer-ones&#34;&gt;Longer ones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;</description>
