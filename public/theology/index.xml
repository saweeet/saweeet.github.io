      <description>&lt;p&gt;For me, this has to be one of, if not &lt;strong&gt;the most important question&lt;/strong&gt; someone can ever ask. We&amp;rsquo;re talking not just about how we came to be, but also why we were made and whether there&amp;rsquo;s life after death. For many, this will never be a priority to ponderâ€”not unless death comes knocking on their door.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My personal reasoning for why I believe has changed progressively over the years and has evolved in many ways. I started as a cradle Catholic and was taught to believe at a very young age. However, like a majority of cradle Catholics, my faith was very watered down. I remember going to a YFC (Youth for Christ) camp and on Day 1, telling everyone that I was just there for the girls. What an embarrassment! However, from that camp I saw that being Christian could be &amp;lsquo;cool&amp;rsquo;. I saw Christians break dancing, rapping, hip-hopping, and singing praise and worship songs. Sure, it may have been a bit superficial, but it was a good start in realizing that being Christian didn&amp;rsquo;t have to mean being boring.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
